# Swift100
My personal journey of HackingWithSwift 100 Days of SwiftUI.

This serves as a means to both relearn Swift and learn SwiftUI, which I have previously not interacted with before. This is especially crucial as at this time my personal career aspirations is to pursue a career in iOS mobile development. I do have a lot of experience with Python and JavaScript throughout my college tenure, but this serves as a means to acclimate myself further with the iOS development ecosystem.
