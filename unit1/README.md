# Unit 1
Introduction to Swift & Syntax (Review for Me)
Note: Skipping on the first few projects/checkpoints because this unit is mostly oriented around introducing syntax (i.e. concepts I familiar with but reviewing)

## Notable Notes:
* Enums
* Case+Switch Statements
* Continue (and breaks) in loops
* Tuples and Sets
* Customizing function parameter labels
  * Omit '\_'
    * Removes the parameter when calling the function
  * for
    * Replaces the first parameter with the key word 'for'
  * Default parameter values
  * Overall adds readability
* Error handling
  * Do, Catch, and Try
    * Try implies that the function can throw a function, whereas not using try on a function means that the function should not be capable of throwing an error.
* Closures (see day 9 for hella notes)
  * So much info
  * Can be used to add custom sorting via .sorted(by: __SORTING_CLOSURE__)
  * 'in' as a keyword to show the parameters of a closure, since the parameters are within the curly brackets
  * $0, $1, $x as shorthand for string inputs in sorting closures to GREATLY reduce clutter
  * Closures apply greatly to .filter and .map as well as a majority of SwiftUI (next unit)
* Functions as parameters
  * See day 9 part 3 for notes.
